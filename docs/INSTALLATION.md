# Installation

These instructions will allow you to install the package and accompanying databases on Linux. Mac OS X computers operate similarly.
For any other systems, or if you cannot install the databases, we recommend installing via [docker](DOCKER.md).

## Pre-requisites

Required:
* MySQL
* Python 3.6 or above
* SQLite version 3.8.0 or above

Optional:
* PostgreSQL version 10.5 or above. 


## Download the source code

To download the VariantValidator source code simply clone the master branch.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/openvar/variantValidator.git
$ cd variantValidator/
```

## Python 3.6 environment

When installing VariantValidator we recommend using a virtual environment, as it requires specific versions of several libraries including python and sqlite. This can be done either via conda **or** pip.

#### Via conda  
After [installing conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) you can create a new virtual environment with the correct python and sqlite versions by running:
```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate vvenv
```
The packages required for VariantValidator to function are now set up in the environment "vvenv".

#### Via pip

If you already have the right versions of python (>=3.6) and sqlite (>=3.8), then you can use pip to BT create a new virtual envionment and install the packages required for VariantValidator to function.

```
$ python -m venv vvenv
$ source activate vvenv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Additional steps for running MariaDB
Install the mariadb python library

***Note: Only do this if you intend to run MariaDB instead of MySQL***
```bash
$ pip install mariadb
```
***Additional steps may be required***
Install [MariaDB Connector/C](https://downloads.mariadb.com/Connectors/c/)
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-c/) 

## Installing VariantValidator

Hint: your new environment vvenv should still be activated from the previous steps and you should still be in the /variantValidator directory where setup.py is located.

To install VariantValidator within your virtual environment run:
```
$ pip install -e .
```

## Setting up validator database (MySQL)

A MySQL database called validator is required to run VariantValidator. We recommend creating a user and password specific to the
validator database, for example:

```mysql
CREATE USER 'USER'@'HOST' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
CREATE DATABASE validator;
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON validator.* TO 'USER'@'HOST';
```
Where:
- USER should be a user-name e.g. vvadmin
- HOST is the MySQL host ID, usually 127.0.0.1
- PASSWORD is a unique password for your database

*Note: We have had reports that on some systems ALL PRIVILEGES may be required rather than SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE*

Download and our pre-populated database to MySQL as follows. 

***Essential Step: check [here](https://www528.lamp.le.ac.uk/vvdata/validator/) and make sure you download and install the most up-to-date version***

```bash
$ wget https://www528.lamp.le.ac.uk/vvdata/validator/validator_2021-07-21.sql.gz
$ gunzip validator_2021-07-21.sql.gz
$ mysql validator < validator_2021-07-21.sql -u HOST -p
```

See the [Manual](MANUAL.md) for instructions on updating this database, which should be done regularly.

```mysql
# a few useful commands once pre-populated database downloaded to MYSQL

mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR '<USER>'@'localhost';
mysql> show databases;
mysql> use <database>;
mysql> show tables;
mysql> describe <table>;
mysql> select * from LRG_transcripts LIMIT 3;
```

If you wish to test your installation using pytest (see below) we recommend that you do this before updating the database. 

## Setting up Seqrepo (SQLite >=3.8)

VariantValidator requires a local SeqRepo database. The seqrepo package has already been installed into the virtual environment, but you'll need to download an actual seqrepo database. This can go anywhere on your system drive.

***Essential Step: check [here](https://www528.lamp.le.ac.uk/vvdata/vv_seqrepo/) and make sure you download and install the most up-to-date version where the required file is
 e.g. VV_SR_2021_2.tar and the numbers indicate the creation date i.e. 2021_02 = February 2021***

```
$ mkdir /path/to/seqrepo
$ cd /path/to/seqrepo
$ wget https://www528.lamp.le.ac.uk/vvdata/vv_seqrepo/VV_SR_2021_2.tar
$ tar -xvf VV_SR_2021_2.tar
$ rm VV_SR_2021_2.tar
```
where /path/to/seqrepo should be where you install the database e.g. /Users/Shared/seqrepo_dumps/ or /local/seqrepo


## Setting up VVTA database (PostGreSQL >=10.5)

You will need to install a local version of the VVTA database. 

```psql
 # When you install PostgreSQL a default admin user 
 # “postgres” is created by the default. 
 # You must use it to log-in to your PostgreSQL database for the first time.

$ sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# \conninfo
postgres=# \l

# And to see a list of all the users with their 
# privileges use \du command.

postgres=# \du
```

First create the database and a user account:

```psql
CREATE ROLE <USER> WITH CREATEDB;
ALTER ROLE <USER> WITH LOGIN;
ALTER ROLE <USER> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
CREATE DATABASE vvta WITH OWNER=<USER> TEMPLATE=template0;
```
Where:
- \<USER\> should be a user-name e.g. uta_admin. [I have found only uta_admin works]
- password is a unique password for user

To fill this database, download the gzipped uta genetics database, and upload it into psql.

***Essential Step: check [here](https://www528.lamp.le.ac.uk/vvdata/vvta/) and make sure you download and install the most up-to-date version***

```
$ wget --output-document=VVTA_2022_02.noseq.psql.gz https://www528.lamp.le.ac.uk/vvdata/vvta/VVTA_2022_02_noseq.sql.gz
$ gzip -cdq VVTA_2022_02.noseq.psql.gz | psql -U <USER> -v ON_ERROR_STOP=0 -d vvta -Eae
OR
$ gzip -cdq vvta_2022_11.1_no_seq.sql.gz | psql -h localhost -U uta_admin -W -v ON_ERROR_STOP=0 -d vvta -Eae

```

Few useful Postgres commands

```psql
# view schemas
vvta=> \dn

# view tables of schema
vvta=> \dt+ vvta_2022_11_1.*;

vvta=> SELECT hgnc_id FROM vvta_2022_11_1.gene LIMIT 10;
```

## Configuration

Before using VariantValidator some configuration is required, as described in the [Manual](MANUAL.md).

## Developers

To work on the VariantValidator code, you'll need to install additional dependencies and install VariantValidator in an editable manner. Tests can be run using PyTest.

```bash
cd variantValidator/
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
pip install -e .
pytest
```
